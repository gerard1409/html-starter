          My name is Shalinder however I feel a name is just any sound to which
          you respond.So lets say I am a human,a living organism, who was lucky
          enough to gain some intelect over years of social evolution.I am
          simply a creature on a quest,on a journey limited by the duration
          called life.Ironically the duration is also the journey. I was and am
          still,a litlle bit,caught up in the vicious cycle of corporate society
          however i strive to set free and also help others with a similiar
          dream,move towards it. Read on to know more

          I believe in today's world the biggest sin is to not be curious. Even
          in today's world when i see people believing in superstition and being
          unaware of the simple facts of life or nature or the general things
          that surround us,it puzzles me. I have realised the biggest hurdle to
          learning is ego and self doubt,two sides of the same coin.However my
          intention personally is to learn as much as possible from everything i
          engage and to pass on the knowlege.Lets strive for enlightenment. To
          see whom
          <a href="philosophersicherish.html">I follow. </a>
